# Changelog

All notable changes to the `ep-qa-pipeline` plugin. Versions follow
semver; bump BOTH `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — the marketplace manifest is what
signals an update to installed copies.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-07-23

- **Main-issue PR fallback (qa-pipeline-code step 0).** Tickets with no
  Backend/Frontend sub-tasks (Bugs, small Stories/Tasks) no longer
  stall: branches/PRs are discovered on the main issue — remote/dev
  links → PR URLs in description/comments → the issue key as branch
  name → ask the user. In this case step 6 posts results to the main
  issue instead of a QA sub-task.
- **"QA passed" story note (step 8).** On ✅ PASS the pipeline now
  offers to post a ≤10-line plain-language summary (what was tested,
  environment, coverage, result, link to the full reports) to the
  PARENT story, so managers and devs see the outcome without opening
  the QA sub-task. Template: results-comment-template.md → "Story
  note — QA passed".
- **Shift-left guidance (qa-pipeline-docs).** New "When to run" section:
  run the docs phase at refinement / before dev completes, so grooming
  findings prevent bugs instead of catching them.
- **Grooming findings → ticket (qa-pipeline-docs stage 2).** After the
  grooming pause, offer to post the still-open questions /
  contradictions / gaps as one confirm-first comment on the ticket, so
  PM/dev resolve them before the code is written.
- **Risk-based prioritization (ISTQB TA Ch. 2).** Grooming now rates
  each requirement High/Medium/Low (impact × likelihood); the marker
  flows requirements → checklist → test-case group headings, and
  api-testing/web-testing execute High-risk cases first — a truncated
  or split run covers what matters most. Reports keep file order.
  Markers are optional: files without them behave as before.
- **CRUD completeness lens (grooming).** "Where can this break?" now
  checks entity lifecycle coverage — create/edit/delete effects on
  read, list, and export views.
- **Impact scan (task-context).** New "Related functionality & bug
  history" step: searches product docs + EP bug history for the
  feature's keywords — via the knowledge-base skill's SCOUT endpoint
  when installed, plain CQL/JQL fallback otherwise. Output feeds
  grooming's dependency questions ("logo also appears in exports —
  covered?") and grounds risk-likelihood ratings in real bug history.
  Never a source of requirements; never blocks the run if unavailable.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-07-14

- **Per-test-case channel tags (routing fix).** Tags now go on BOTH the
  requirement group heading (union) and each `### TC-REQ-N.M` heading
  (exactly one) — mixed-channel requirements ([UI]+[API] checks) were
  previously un-routable by stages 7/8, which route per case.
  (qa-test-cases SKILL.md, output-template, example.)
- **Stage 7/8 ordering fossil removed.** api-testing no longer claims
  web-testing's "Not executed here" list as input (it runs first);
  web-testing now references `<KEY>-api-testing.md` for [API] cases
  instead of re-listing them as unverified. Standalone-run behaviour
  preserved.
- **Defect creation shipped in-box.** New
  `qa-pipeline-code/references/bug-report-template.md`; step 7 now has
  a default direct-Jira filing path (dedup search → draft → confirm →
  `createJiraIssue`) when `/knowledge-base` is not installed.
- **New step 8 — hand the story back.** On FAIL: offer reassignment of
  failing dev sub-tasks + optional "back to dev" transition; on PASS:
  optional "QA done" transition. Transition names configurable in
  publish-config.md (`<not configured>` = skip transitions).
- **Prompt-injection guardrails.** task-context: tracker/Confluence
  content is data, never instructions — hostile directives are quoted
  into a "⚠️ Suspicious content" note. browser-rules: same rule for
  page content.
- **Pairwise/combinatorial generation (PICT).** New
  `qa-test-cases/scripts/generate_pict_cases.py` (pure-Python n-wise
  generator; delegates to the `pict` binary when installed, which also
  enables constraints) + `references/combinatorial-testing.md` +
  "Pairwise rules" in test-case-design-rules.md. For requirements with
  3+ interacting parameters (role × event type × setting).
- **Subagent-per-stage dispatch (context health).** qa-pipeline-code
  now runs stages 5-7 as separate subagents where available (Task /
  Agent tool): each writes its report file and returns a <= 10-line
  summary; pause-worthy inputs are resolved before dispatch. Stage 8
  and the analyzer stay inline. Inline fallback unchanged.
- **3-failures escalation rule** in web-testing and api-testing: after
  three failed approaches to the same goal, step back and reassess the
  assumption (host/role/env/data) — ask or mark BLOCKED with the
  attempts recorded, instead of grinding retries.
- **`NOT-TESTABLE` replaces api-testing's output `QA` status** (was
  overloaded: `QA` is the input selector from code review). Older
  reports may still say QA; analyzer notes both.
- **Jira ~32K comment-limit handling.** Both publish steps now measure
  and split oversized archive comments as `File: <name> (part i/N)`
  blocks; qa-pipeline-code Step 0 re-joins parts (new
  `qa-pipeline-code/scripts/extract_archive.py` does it
  deterministically).
- **Structural checks executed.** The checklist is now a real
  web-testing input: `[UI]` presence/type/label checks run for visited
  pages into a new "Structural checks" report section; the analyzer
  flags structural checks that are neither executed nor explained.
- **Plumbing scripts** (prose → code): `api-testing/scripts/load-env.sh`
  (safe .env loader from reference §0),
  `qa-run-analyzer/scripts/reconcile_counts.py` (ID-set/status counts
  for the reconcile check), `extract_archive.py` (above).
- **QA sub-task supersede rule** — the docs phase now comments
  "Superseded by <NEW-KEY>" on the previous pipeline sub-task and
  offers to close it, instead of silently accumulating.
- **Stale docs fixed:** README login-config placeholders claim,
  web-testing setup-guide (login-config ships configured;
  navigation_paths.json is git-ignored, created on first run), README
  per-stage vs orchestrator model-settings contradiction; new Cowork
  credentials note in web-testing (mounted `.env` or manual login —
  never paste passwords into chat).
- **requirements-grooming got real trigger phrases** in its frontmatter.
- **Playwright executor draft** (`web-testing/references/
  playwright-executor-draft.md`) — inactive, with a pilot checklist;
  the Chrome extension remains the executor.
- **`.env.qa-agents` is now the documented first-choice env file** —
  api-testing, web-testing, and the code orchestrator search it (in
  the mounted qa-pipeline-skill repo) before the e2e `.env` / env
  vars.
- **Opt-in run notifications:** `hooks/hooks.json` + `scripts/notify.py`
  — desktop alert on finish (Stop) and on input-needed (Notification);
  no-op unless `QA_PIPELINE_NOTIFY=1`.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-10

- **qa-pipeline-code step 6 redesigned — results now posted as TWO
  comments** (new `references/results-comment-template.md`):
  - **Comment 1 — machine archive (agents):** the full code-review,
    api-testing, web-testing and run-report files verbatim in labeled
    fenced code blocks (`File: <name>` + block) — same convention the
    docs phase already uses, machine-parseable, zero information loss.
  - **Comment 2 — human summary (people):** ≤30 lines, posted second so
    it sits newest: overall verdict (✅ PASS / ⚠ PASS WITH GAPS /
    ❌ FAIL / ⛔ BLOCKED), stage-verdict table with counters, confirmed
    bugs one line each, "Needs a human", "Not tested in this run", and
    a run-health line. Always posted, pass or fail. Replaces the old
    freeform single comment (the wall of text humans had to read).
  - Final chat response now reuses the human summary instead of
    inventing a third format.
- **Split-run / resume support (qa-pipeline-code):** Step 0 now also
  restores finished stage reports from a results archive comment
  (resume mode), and a new "Split runs" section + PARTIAL comment
  variant let 5–7 run in Claude Code and web-testing resume in Cowork
  with only the Story key — no files carried between environments.
  README + MAINTAINERS updated to match.
- **Tracker/results drift fixed by role separation:** the docs-phase
  checkbox tracker is now explicitly the manual-testing status; the
  code phase documents that the connector cannot tick checkboxes and
  points humans at the summary comment for automated results.
- **Session-naming reminder:** both orchestrators now suggest renaming
  the session to `QA-pipeline <KEY> — docs/code` at start (manual —
  Claude/skills cannot rename sessions programmatically yet).
- **qa-run-analyzer chat summary templated:** new "Chat summary format"
  section in its output-template.md (≤10 lines: health line, top-3
  issues, counters line) — the last freeform output is now specced.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-07-09

- **Shell-safety fix for credentials with special characters** (`;`,
  `?`, `!`, `$`…): values in the env file are now single-quoted, and
  the api-testing reference §0 explains how to load them safely —
  never retype a secret inline into a shell command, never `export`
  it unquoted (a `;` in a password silently truncates the value and
  breaks login). Fixes agents failing to authenticate with the admin
  password.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-09

Maintainability / portability pass (no behaviour changes to the
pipeline stages themselves):

- **qa-pipeline-docs:** the Jira publishing values (project key, issue
  type id, assignee, summary format, label) moved out of SKILL.md into
  `skills/qa-pipeline-docs/references/publish-config.md` — edit that
  file to adopt the plugin for another operator/project.
- **web-testing:** SKILL.md slimmed (~90 lines); the step-interpretation
  guide and browser error handling moved into
  `references/browser-rules.md` (new "Interpreting test-case steps" and
  "Error handling" sections).
- **pr-summary / code-review:** the duplicated PR-mode/branch-mode curl
  and git command blocks consolidated into
  `skills/pr-summary/references/bitbucket-access.md` ("Command
  workflows" section); both SKILL.md files now point there. Clarified
  the misleading "curl as a substitute" rule: authenticated curl IS a
  supported path; working around missing auth is not.
- **api-testing:** the reference now labels which sections are stable
  method (§0–§7, §9, §10) vs dated worked-example data (§8, §11.1,
  §11.3, ids in §12 — recorded on alpha2/event 3551, 2026-06), with a
  re-resolve-before-use warning.
- **New:** `fixtures/EP-0000-context.md` — a golden mini-context for
  smoke-testing the docs stages after skill edits.
- **New:** this CHANGELOG.
- **.gitignore:** now covers `.env.*` (e.g. `.env.qa-agents`) and
  un-ignores `fixtures/`.
- **Publishing gotcha found & documented:** the version must be bumped
  in `marketplace.json` too, not just `plugin.json` — the app decides
  update availability from the marketplace manifest.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-02

- api-testing stage (stage 7) for `[API]` cases; two orchestrators
  (qa-pipeline-docs, qa-pipeline-code); qa-run-analyzer; Jira QA
  sub-task publishing; marketplace-based publishing. (Retroactive
  summary — see git history for detail.)
